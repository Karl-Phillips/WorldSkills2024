# Introduction

   Welcome to the WorldSkills Australia 2024 Regional Competition in
   PROGRAMMING.

   Worldskills Australia is a social enterprise that passionately
   believes skills drive the future of young people, and of Australia.

   We are part of an International Worldskills movement.

   We have been enabling young people to showcase their trade and skills
   talents since 1981. WorldSkills Australia aims to encourage
   Australians to celebrate vocational education and training, shift
   perceptions and create the understanding that to learn a skill, to
   choose a skills-based career, is one of the most important decisions a
   young person and their family will ever make.

   Our skills-based competitions operate at regional, national and
   international levels, and are aligned to National Training Packages,
   Apprenticeships Australia and Jobs Australia schemes.

   The Regional Competition is a one-day competition and the first step
   on your journey with WorldSkills Australia, that could lead to you
   competing at the National Championships and depending on eligibility
   International Championships and Scholarship pathways.

MARK UP TO 13 COMPETITORS (LA
MARKING PROCEDURE
• Judges must use and follow the marking scale provided by WorldSkills Australia without making any
alterations to the marking scale.
• All marks are to be transferred to the marking summary form (one per competitor) and cross checked
for accuracy
• There should always be two people entering marks – one to enter, one to check
• Once the results have been tallied, all judges should confirm and sign results on the front page of the
Marking Summary.
• There can only be one gold medal, one silver medal and one bronze medal awarded for each
competition.
• In the event of a tied mark, please review “How to Split a tie” procedure
• For training on the marking system/scale please contact WorldSkills Australia
MARKING PROCEDURE USING MEASUREMENT:
Used to assess accuracy, precision and other performance which can and should be measured in a robust
way. It is used where there should be no ambiguity.
• Min 2 judges in marking team, with an independent judge where required to prevent judges marking
own competitor
• Judges in judging team must mark together and agree on one combined score per competitor per
aspect
Measurement based marks should be given a YES or NO
Example 1:
Criteria H1: Has the competitor maintained a tidy and safe work area during the competition
The judges in the judging team must agree that each competitor has or has not maintained a tidy and safe
work area
If the judges agree to a YES - the competitor will be awarded 2 marks
If the judges agree to a NO – the competitor will be awarded 0 marks (no half marks can be awarded)
In the event of the judging team not being able to agree on a mark, the Chief Judge will have the casting
decision based on feedback from the judges.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
INTRODUCTION
WorldSkills Australia promotes and supports the integration of sustainability into WorldSkills competition
design and processes. WorldSkills competition project designers across all skills have embraced the challenge
to include sustainability concepts and methods in projects design criteria and the conduct of the skil l at the
competition.
This trend aligns with social and industry standards regarding sustainability and the results achieved at
previous competitions can be regarded as significant for WorldSkills Australia and their project designers.
Society and industry in general stand to benefit from this impact, as judges, competitors, suppliers and
volunteers, those who influence and shape workplace attitudes and standards, will take away what they learnt
at the competition and practice sustainable methods and concepts in their workplace.
REPORT
SUBCATEGORY METHOD & CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABILITY
ENERGY & CARBON
EFFICIENCY
• Recommendations are that energy efficient hardware is selected for
competition use where possible
• Competitors must be encouraged to use power saving options
• We would like to install energy monitoring devices to track usage
• We always ensure that unused computers/equipment are turned off
• We would like to use energy efficient lighting for competitors’
workstations wherever possible. Our lighting requirements are low
and only need to illuminate the competitors’ desks
WASTE MANAGEMENT
• This competition does not produce waste as the only materials we
use are electricity and brain power.
• The project has been written so that competitors are never required
to produce printed output; everything can be marked onscreen
• We have designed the competitors’ instructions in such a way that
they can be viewed on screen while they are working (on a second
monitor) so that their instructions do not need to be printed.
• All equipment can be borrowed from local colleges, business, etc. so
that equipment does not need to be purchased and sold for the
competition
RECYCLING & REUSING
• We would like to push to have recycling bins throughout our category
for judges and competitors to use. Although we do not have waste
during the competition times, there will be food packaging during
breaks.
WATER MANAGEMENT
• The only water we use is for drinking, so we are a very water efficient
category. In fact, water and computers do not mix, so we actively
keep water away from our category.
TRANSPORT & DELIVERY
• In most cases, the equipment we use is sources from local RTOs,
business, suppliers, etc., so there is very minimal transport of
materials and equipment.
• The bulk of our resources are electronic, so they effectively require
no transport whatsoever for the entire instructions and software for
the competition.
• Aside from allowing our competitors to use their own keyboard and
mouse, all of the rest of the equipment (all tools) are supplied locally
for the competition. No toolboxes are transported for our entire
category.
2024 Regional Competition Pack -Programming ©WorldSkills Australia 2024. All rights reserved. 34
HAZARDOUS & TOXIC
MATERIALS
• This competition does not use hazardous and toxic materials waste
• No computer equipment is disposed of during the competition, so there
is no risk of harmful substances being improperly disposed of
COMMUNITY & SOCIAL
BENEFITS
• Our entire competition is based around a single case study of a relevant
business. Previously, we have not been able to find a business that
required a system of relevant size/complexity for the competition, so we
have had to rely on using a fictional scenario/client. If we could find an
appropriate real-life match for our category, we would definitely develop
a system that would benefit a real client!
• Throughout the entire competition, our category has an aspect of
“professionalism”. Within this, we mark accessibility (for disabilities,
visual impairments, gender imbalance, etc.), usability, etc.
• During the competition, we like to show spectators what can be done with
software so that they are educated about it and inspired to learn more.
With this knowledge, they can also see how to maximize the efficiency of
many processes in their workplaces.
ECONOMIC BENEFITS
• The category is one of the least costly and least wasteful categories to
run. In most cases there is no need for any purchasing of equipment or
consumables as the competition can be run in any computer facility.
• All equipment can be sourced locally from RTOs, businesses, suppliers,
etc., so transport costs are kept to a minimum
• The project is prepared entirely by volunteers and so there is no financial
cost to WorldSkills for its development
• We ensure that industry personnel are involved in writing the competition
to make sure that best practices are being used and that up to date
techniques (including green computing where possible) are used.
