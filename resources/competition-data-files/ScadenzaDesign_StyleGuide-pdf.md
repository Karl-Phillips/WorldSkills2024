Logo

   The Ticked Off logo shown below must be used in the header of all
   printed outputs and user interfaces. This will ensure one cohesive and
   consistent system is developed.

Colours

   The following colour swatches have been sampled from the Ticked Off
   logo. For branding reasons, it is essential that you focus mainly on
   these colours for all major elements of the system you are developing.

Blue: R: 0 G: 87 B: 172 #0057AC
Green: R: 0 G: 178 B: 45 #00B22D
Red: R: 140 G: 35 B: 0 #8C2300
White: R: 255 G: 255 B: 255 #FFFFFF
Theme

   To ensure consistency between applications and documents, a Microsoft
   Office Theme can be created for Ticked Off and applied to each part of
   the system.

Professionalism

   Professionalism has been identified as a key quality for Ticked Off's
   image as a respected business. This means ensuring that all parts of
   the system are clean, consistent, visuallyappealing, and free of
   spelling and grammatical errors. User interfaces and printed outputs
   must be easy to read and easy to understand.

Headers and Footers

   For consistency, all parts of the system must have the same header and
   footer where appropriate. The header must include the Ticked Off logo
   and any other relevant information.

   The footer must include the page number (in “x of y” format) and the
   filename of the current file. Both must automatically update.

Layout

   All printed outputs and user interfaces must use a header. All printed
   outputs must use a footer showing page numbering and the current date.

   Ensure the entire system makes good use of alignment and whitespace.
   Also ensure that elements are logically grouped together where need be
   to make the system easier-to-use for users.

Sample interface
Please refer to the sample interface (on the next page) for the following aspects:
- Colours
- Layout of elements
- Alignment of elements
- Appropriate use of whitespace
- Logical grouping of elements
- Formatting of
o Title text
o Body text
o Inputs
- Layout and formatting of navigation (for forms)
- Use of header image (Ticked Off logo)
- All other design factors

   Although this concept drawing is specifically of a form, the same
   design considerations must apply to all interfaces you develop for
   this system. Interfaces are defined as being any point that the end
   user comes in contact with the finished system, including forms,
   reports, letters, etc.
